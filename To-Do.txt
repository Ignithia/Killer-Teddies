Known bugs:
- If you jump from the first to the utmost right platform, you don't land on it because the Y value is already below the platform Y value.

Possible plans:
- Player capable of dying
- More enemy types that spawn randomly
- Random placed platforms
- More aesthetics (don't know which yet)
- Think of more possible aesthetics
- More world building and exploration
- Better enemy AI (Jumping and Player targetting)

Certain To-Do's:
- Be angry at ChatGPT for providing horrible assistance over and over (Might be a skill issue on my part as well)
- Fix bugs (unless it becomes a feature)
- More fixing of bugs
