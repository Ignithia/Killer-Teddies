Known bugs:
- If you jump from the first to the utmost right platform, you don't land on it because the Y value is already below the platform Y value. (Version 3 or lower)

Possible plans:
- Player capable of dying (added in v4)
- More enemy types that spawn randomly
- Better enemy AI (Jumping and Player targetting) 
- Random placed platforms (Tested and failed may revisit later)
- More aesthetics (don't know which yet)
- More world building and exploration (May revisit later)
- Change code into classes (v5 or v6)

Certain To-Do's:
- Make power-ups have a visual effect to the player
- Clean up the code for better readability (v5)
- Unify the players so it's not lengthy since both contain the same logic pretty much
